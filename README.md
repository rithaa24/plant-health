## 📖 Overview

Plant Health is a React Native mobile application designed to help users monitor the health of their plants.  The app leverages device capabilities (camera, potentially sensors if implemented) to aid in diagnosing plant issues and providing personalized care recommendations.  The target audience includes home gardeners, plant enthusiasts, and anyone looking to improve their plant care practices.  The app aims to solve common problems like identifying plant diseases, determining appropriate watering schedules, and providing insights into optimal growing conditions.

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Image-based Plant Disease Diagnosis:** Capture images of your plant's leaves to receive potential disease diagnoses (currently under development, requires a backend API integration).
- 💧 **Smart Watering Recommendations:** Based on factors such as plant type, environmental conditions, and soil moisture (sensor integration required), this feature helps users avoid overwatering or underwatering their plants.
- ☀️ **Light and Temperature Monitoring:**  Provides information and guidance based on the appropriate light and temperature requirements for the specific plant.
- 🌱 **Plant Database:**  Includes a database of common houseplants with individual needs and care guidelines.
- 🌿 **Personalized Care Plan:**  Generates tailored care recommendations for each plant.
- 📅 **Plant Care Reminders:** Set reminders to water, fertilize, and repot your plants.
